# Student Workbook

An amalgamation of programming and school problem solving. A programmatic problem solving solving approach without needing to know about programming. An unique interface, lays emphasis on the steps involved in solving problems. It consists of a solution board and formula cards. Formula cards are dragged into solution space. Variable references or constants are set for each of the formula. Final answer is evaluated from processing the first to last formula cards / steps of the solution space.
